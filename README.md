## Concept: 
A non-utility website where people can enter the city that they are in, along with keywords regarding what store they are looking for. From there, the website will spit out a store in the city that contains most if not all of the keywords the user entered. They can repeat that until they are bored or until a desired result is given.

## To Run

- npm install
- to run it locally:
  - $nodemon$ or $npm start$
