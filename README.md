## Concept: 
A non-utility website where people can enter the city that they are in, along with keywords regarding what store they are looking for. From there, the website will spit out a store in the city that contains most if not all of the keywords the user entered. They can repeat that until they are bored or until a desired result is given.

## Execution:
I used the google Places API to help find the location that the user input, using it for the backdrop and for the location of the store. I then have the user enter keywords that describe what they are looking for. They need a minimum of 2 keywords before a store can be generated for them.
